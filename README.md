# CQAS

This repository presents the codes used to implement the heterogeneous network scenario and the CQAS scheduling algorithm for the work entitled "A new Channel and QoS Aware Scheduler algorithm for real-time and non-real-time traffic in 5G heterogeneous networks".

The Vienna 5G System Level Simulator can be found in https://www.tuwien.at/etit/tc/vienna-simulators/vienna-5g-simulators/.
Release 1.4 of the Vienna 5G System Level Simulator is available since October 2023 under an academic use license. The simulator requires the MATLAB software (2020b or newer version) and the following toolboxes are optional:
- Parallel Computing Toolbox (for running simulations chunks in parallel)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (for generating Poisson distributed network element positions and some traffic models)
- Communications Toolbox (for using the MATLAB ray tracer)
- CVX (for the Quality of Service (QoS) aware scheduler)
- licensed QUAsi Deterministic RadIo channel GenerAtor (QuaDRiGa) source code (for using the QuaDRiGa channel models)
